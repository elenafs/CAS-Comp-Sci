What kind of value does the function getFirstVowel return?
It returns the string characters
Of the three ways that you unwrapped the value of firstVowel, which do you feel was most appropriate for this situation, and why?
The double Questions mark (??) operator was the most condensed form of unwrapping the firstVowel value
This exercise assumes that you do, in fact, have a vowel (of the English language) in your name. What, if anything, would you need to change about the code if your name was "Bj√∏rk" or "Ghrftnx"?
Increase parameters, so that the code can run a variable without a vowels
